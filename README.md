Airbnb, Inc is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. 
Based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via a website and mobile app. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; 
instead, it profits by receiving a commission from each booking. 

The company was founded in 2008. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com. About Dataset Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a 
more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in New York City. 
Listings, including full descriptions and average review score Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments Calendar, including listing id and the price and 
availability for that day.
